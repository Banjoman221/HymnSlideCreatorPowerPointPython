"Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken"
Glory to His Name
Jesus Paid It All
The Way of the Cross Leads Home
When I Survey the Wonderous Cross
beneath the cross of Jesus
I gave my life for thee
I am coming to the cross
room at the cross for you
near the cross
He died for me
blessed Redeemer
must Jesus bear the cross alone?
kneel at the cross
lead me to Calvary
majestic sweetness sits enthroned
One day!
take the name of Jesus with you
there's a fountain
when I see the blood
what a wonderful Saviour!
Are you washed in the blood?
there's power in the blood
and can it be that I should gain?
wounded for me
hallelujah for the cross!
The old rugged Cross
Alas! and did my savior bleed?
at the cross
nothing but the blood
He lives
He lives on high
"Christ, the Lord is risen today"
I know that my redeemer liveth
when I see my savior
Christ arose!
there'll be no dark valley
hallelujah! we shall rise!
how beautiful heaven must be
no disappointment in heaven
Sweet by and by
My latest sun is thinking fast
we're marching to Zion
Will work to Jesus comes
when I can read my title clear
My Savior first of all
let the sun shine again in my heart
I'll be so glad
meet me there
"Peace, perfect peace"
where we'll never grow old
Zions Hill
Beulah Land
Oh that will be glory!
when the roll is called up yonder
when we all get to heaven
when they ring the Golden bells
He the pearly Gates will open
caught up together
face to face
We'll never say goodbye
saved by grace
what a day that will be
shall we gather at the river?
Just over in the gloryland
at Calvary
The pearly White City
remembering in heaven
we shall shine as the stars
Well Jesus find us watching ?
there's a great day coming
is it the crowning day?
some Golden daybreak
Christ returneth
on Jordans Stormy Banks
what if it were today?
"behold, he comes!"
Jesus is coming
when Jesus comes to reign
coming today?
when we see Christ
when he cometh
I'm going higher
Jesus is coming again
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!
in the garden
Just when I need him most
some Time we'll understand
does Jesus care?
"Jesus, lover of my soul"
hiding in thee
how can I be lonely?
"art thou weary, art thou languid ?"
stand by me
The Lord is my shepherd
God leads us along
I need thee every hour
The name of Jesus
"come, ye disconsolate "
day by day
Jesus never fails
He hide it my soul
under his wings
Lean on his arms
All that thrills my soul
abide with me
praise the Savior
sun of my soul
" saviour, like a shepherd lead us"
All the way my savior leads us
"Sweet peace, the gift of God's love"
"be still, my soul"
wonderful peace
The great physician
no one ever cared for me like Jesus
He leadeth me
safe in the arms of Jesus
near the heart of God
Till the storm passes by
"Jesus, Savior, pilot me"
like a river glorious
"Oh God, our help"
The Christian's good-night
God will take care of you
The solid rock
anywhere with Jesus
Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
each step I take
Rock of ages
"yesterday, today, forever"
Christ is all I need
never alone!
safe wherever I go
My anchor holds
I know I am saved
"Master, the tempest is raging"
in times like these
The Haven of rest
I know whom I have believed
we have an anchor
what will you say then?
The old time religion
blessed assurance
a mighty fortress is our God
It is well with my soul
a shelter in the time of storm
leaning on the everlasting arms
"Jesus, only Jesus"
trusting Jesus
My faith has found a resting place
I do believe
security
how firm a foundation
blessed be the tie that binds
doxology
Jesus is the sweetest name I know
"come, thou almighty King"
o for a thousand tongues to sing
blessed be the name
crown him with many crowns
our great saviour
to God be the glory
when Morning gilds The skies
praise him! praise him!
O worship the king
I will praise him
All hail the power of Jesus' name
All hail the power of Jesus' name
"come, thou fount"
"hallelujah, what a saviour!"
Jesus! The very thought of thee
"Love Divine, all loves excelling"
Love lifted me
"My Jesus, I love thee!"
it's just like his great love
Jesus loves the little children
when love shines in
Jesus loves even me
such love
isn't the love of Jesus? something wonderful
I love him
wonderful story of love
Oh how I love Jesus
"I love the, my Jesus"
My savior's love
Jesus loves me
Jesus loves me
The love of God
I never will cease to love him
"wonderful, wonderful Jesus"
in my heart there rings a melody
Ring the bells of heaven
you may have the joy bells
since Jesus came into my heart
I will sing of the mercies
I will sing the wondrous story
singing I go
Joy unspeakable
let the joy overflow
He's a wonderful saviour to me
"Jesus, I am resting"
My Redeemer
The windows of heaven
songs in the mountains
He keeps me singing.
"Oh! say, but I'm glad"
only a sinner
Grace greater than our sin
Sunshine in the soul
wonderful grace of Jesus
"""Whosoever"" meaneth me"
Oh Happy Day!
There is glory in my soul
buildeth on the rock
heaven came down and Glory filled my soul
surely goodness and mercy
He included me
"hallelujah, 'Tis done"
My burdens rolled away
Jesus is all the world to me
a child of the king
moment by moment
springs of living water
There shall be showers of blessing
nor silver nor gold
I've found a friend
saved by the blood
I love to tell the story
since I have been redeemed
heavenly sunlight
sunlight
Tell me the story of Jesus
"Tell me the old, old, story"
He is so precious to me
"I know I love thee better, Lord"
"no, not one!"
The cleansing Wave
Christ liveth in me
seeking for me
The Lily of the valley
Oh it is wonderful!
It took a miracle
victory in Jesus
amazing Grace!
The old account was settled
redeemed
"saved, saved!"
now I belong to Jesus
saved!
burdens are lifted at Calvary
If I gained the world
whiter then snow
""" you must be born again"""
"""whosoever will"""
come and dine
look to the Lamb of God
look and live
Christ receiveth sinful men
Jesus saves
He is able to deliver thee
turn your eyes upon Jesus
The light of the world is Jesus
"verily, verily"
once for all
someone's last call
Honey in the Rock
"Yes, I know!"
what did he do?
why do you wait?
Just as I am
"Lord, I'm coming home"
"Jesus, I come"
what will you do with Jesus ?
come unto me
almost persuaded
where he leads me
only trust him
Jesus is calling
let Jesus come into your heart
softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
"pass me not, oh gentle saviour"
why not now?
have you any room for Jesus?
who at my door is standing?
into my heart
The nail scarred hand
Open your hearts door
I am resolved
"come, sinner, come!"
let him in
"I am coming, Lord"
his way with thee
is your all on the altar?
stepping in the light
back to Bethel
follow on
close to thee
More like the master
something for thee
ashamed of Jesus
